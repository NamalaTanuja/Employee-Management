Employee Management System
Abstract:
The Employee Management System (EMS) is a Java-based application developed to automate and simplify employee data handling in an organization.
It performs core operations such as adding, updating, deleting, and viewing employee records. 
By replacing manual methods with an efficient digital system, EMS enhances data accuracy, accessibility, and security. 
This project uses the DAO (Data Access Object) design pattern, promoting modularity and code maintenance. It can be extended into a web-based or database-driven application.
Objective:
The main objective of this project is to build a simple and user-friendly software tool that helps organizations manage employee details efficiently. 
The system aims to reduce errors, save time, and ensure better accessibility of employee information.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Java
Tools: Eclipse
Design Pattern: DAO (Data Access Object)
Future Scope: Integration with MySQL, Spring Boot, Web UI
Features:
1. Add Employee
2. Update Employee
3. Delete Employee
4. View Employee
5. View All Employees
6. Exit
System Architecture:
The application is divided into three layers:
 Presentation Layer: Console-based UI using Scanner
 Business Logic Layer: Main application logic with menu
 Data Access Layer: EmployeeDAO handles data operations (can be connected to a database in future)
Before EMS vs After EMS

Before EMS:
1.Manual and paper-based data handling
2.High chance of errors
3.Time-consuming process
4.Difficult to update and retrieve records
5.Weak security

After EMS:
1.Digital and centralized data management
2.Minimal errors
3.Fast and efficient operations
4.Easy updates and retrieval
5.Better security and backup options
 Advantages:
1.Time-saving and efficient
2.Easy access and updates
3.Reduces manual errors
4.Centralized data system
5.Scalable and secure
6.Eco-friendly (less paper usage)
Disadvantages / Limitations:
1.Initial training may be required
2.No GUI or database in the console version
3.Not very user-friendly for non-technical users
4.Dependent on system availability
Future Scope:
1.Integration with MySQL or Oracle DB
2.Convert to web-based application using Spring Boot + Angular/React
3.Add authentication and login features
4.Generate reports in PDF or Excel
5.Cloud integration for remote access
 Conclusion:
The Employee Management System successfully meets the goal of reducing manual efforts and increasing efficiency in managing employee data.
It lays a solid foundation for more complex HR systems and demonstrates practical use of object-oriented programming and design patterns.
